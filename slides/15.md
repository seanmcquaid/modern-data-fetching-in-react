# ......but what's a Client Component?

- Client Components are STILL rendered on the server! They are just also rendered on the client at request time
- Allows you to write interactive UI/client side JavaScript
- Cover Hydration here
- In Next.js, you need to include the "use client" directive in the file to mark it as a Client Component to define the boundary between the server and the client
- By defining a "use client" in a file, all other modules imported into it, including child components, are considered part of the client bundle
