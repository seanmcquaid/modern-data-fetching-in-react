# ......Wait what's a Server Component???

- Allows you to write UI/JSX that can be rendered and optionally cached on PURELY the server
- This means you can write components that can be rendered on the server without having to worry about any Client Side JS being sent to the Browser
- By default, Next.js defaults to Server Components UNLESS you include the "use client" directive at the top of the file to mark it as a Client Component

## Benefits of Server Components

- Data Fetching/any async operations can be handled IN THE COMPONENT!!!!
- Smaller bundle sizes
- Better initial page load and first contentful paint
- Streaming data from the server to the client (Allows the user to see parts of the page earlier without having wait for the entire page to render on the server)
